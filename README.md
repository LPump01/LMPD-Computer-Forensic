<h1>LMPD Computer Forensic Examination</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Given an older LMPD digital image I was given a list of questions and tasked with justifying my answers through whatever evidence I could find. Using the AccessData FTK Imager and Autopsy Digital Forensics, I was able to uncover a significant amount of information. Above the "README.md" is a PDF file where you can view my report with all the questions and evidence I used.
